# Don't Set State Manually

In React, you should avoid setting state manually for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that React relies on its own mechanisms to track and manage state changes, ensuring proper component updates and rendering. Manually setting state outside of React's prescribed methods can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. Here's an explanation with code examples to illustrate why you should not set state manually:

**Why You Shouldn't Set State Manually:**

1. **Loss of React's Control:** Manually setting state bypasses React's built-in state management. React relies on state updates triggered by methods like `setState` or state hooks like `useState` to properly schedule and batch updates.

2. **Asynchronous Updates:** React may batch multiple state updates together for performance reasons. Manually setting state may lead to unpredictable behavior when React's internal batching mechanism is not respected.

3. **Component Reconciliation:** React uses a process called "reconciliation" to determine which parts of the virtual DOM need to be updated. Manually modifying state can disrupt this process and result in incorrect rendering.

**Example:**

Here's an example that demonstrates the issue of manually setting state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ManualStateSettingExample() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Manually setting state (avoid this)
  function manuallyIncrementCount() {
    count += 1; // Manually modifying state
    // This will not trigger React to update the component
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Manual State Setting Example</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={manuallyIncrementCount}>Manually Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ManualStateSettingExample />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we have a component that manually modifies the `count` state by incrementing it using `count += 1`. This approach bypasses React's state management and won't trigger the component to re-render correctly.

To ensure predictable and reliable state management in React, always use the provided state management mechanisms, such as `setState` or state hooks like `useState`, to update state values.
