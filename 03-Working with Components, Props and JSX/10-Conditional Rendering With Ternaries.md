# Conditional Rendering With Ternaries

Conditional rendering in React can also be achieved using ternary operators. Ternaries are useful when you need to choose between two different elements or components to render based on a condition. Here's an explanation with code examples:

Suppose you want to conditionally render different text based on a specific condition.

**Conditional Rendering with Ternary Operators in React:**

1. In your React component, define the condition that determines which element or component to render.

2. Use a ternary operator (`condition ? trueElement : falseElement`) to specify the elements or components that should be rendered based on the condition.

Here's a code example of conditional rendering with ternary operators in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ConditionalRenderComponent() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to our website!</h2>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <p>You are logged in.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in to access your account.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ConditionalRenderComponent;
```

In this example, the `isLoggedIn` variable determines which `<p>` element to render. If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, it renders "You are logged in." If `isLoggedIn` is `false`, it renders "Please log in to access your account."

Using ternary operators for conditional rendering in React is a powerful way to choose between different components or elements based on a condition, making your components more dynamic and flexible.
