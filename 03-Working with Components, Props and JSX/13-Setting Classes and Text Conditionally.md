# Setting Classes and Text Conditionally

In React, you can conditionally set CSS classes and text content based on certain conditions. This is often done by using JavaScript expressions within JSX. Here's an explanation with code examples:

**Setting Classes and Text Conditionally in React:**

1. Use conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and ternary operators within your JSX to determine which classes or text to apply.

2. Define CSS classes or text content dynamically by evaluating the conditions.

Here are some examples:

**Conditional Class Names:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ConditionalClassExample({ isActive }) {
  return (
    <div className={`box ${isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}`}>
      This box is {isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}.
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Conditional Classes in React</h2>
      <ConditionalClassExample isActive={true} />
      <ConditionalClassExample isActive={false} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `isActive` prop determines the CSS class and text content applied to the box. If `isActive` is `true`, it adds the "active" class and displays "This box is active"; otherwise, it adds the "inactive" class and displays "This box is inactive."

**Conditional Text Content:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ConditionalTextExample({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <p>Welcome, user!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in to access your account.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Conditional Text Content in React</h2>
      <ConditionalTextExample isLoggedIn={true} />
      <ConditionalTextExample isLoggedIn={false} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `isLoggedIn` prop determines the text content displayed. If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, it shows a welcome message; otherwise, it prompts the user to log in.

These examples demonstrate how to set classes and text conditionally in React components by using JavaScript expressions to control the rendering based on various conditions.
