# Template Literals

Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a way to create dynamic strings in JavaScript. They offer a more convenient and flexible syntax for working with strings compared to traditional string concatenation. Template literals are enclosed by backticks (\`) instead of single or double quotes.

Here are key features and uses of template literals:

1. **String Interpolation**: Template literals allow you to embed expressions or variables directly within the string using `${}`. For example:

   ```javascript
   const name = 'Alice';
   const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

2. **Multiline Strings**: Template literals can span multiple lines without the need for line breaks or special characters. This makes it easy to create multiline strings:

   ```javascript
   const message = `This is a
   multiline
   string.`;
   ```

3. **Expression Evaluation**: Inside `${}`, you can include any JavaScript expression, and it will be evaluated and included in the resulting string. For example:

   ```javascript
   const num1 = 5;
   const num2 = 7;
   const sum = `The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${num1 + num2}.`;
   ```

4. **Tagged Template Literals**: You can create custom functions (tag functions) that process template literals before they are interpolated. This allows for advanced string manipulation.

   ```javascript
   function myTag(strings, ...values) {
     // Custom logic here
   }

   const result = myTag`The value is ${value}.`;
   ```

Template literals provide a cleaner and more readable way to create dynamic strings, making JavaScript code that involves string manipulation and interpolation more elegant and maintainable.
