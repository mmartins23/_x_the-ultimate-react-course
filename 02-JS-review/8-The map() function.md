# The map() function

The `map()` method in JavaScript is used to transform an array by applying a provided function to each element in the array. It creates a new array containing the results of applying the function to each element. Here's an explanation and a code example of the `map()` method:

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.map(function(currentValue, index, array) {
  // Function to transform each element
}, thisArg);
```

- `currentValue`: The current element being processed.
- `index` (optional): The index of the current element.
- `array` (optional): The array `map()` was called upon.
- `thisArg` (optional): An object to which the `this` keyword can refer in the function.

**Example: Using `map()` to Double Each Element:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example:

1. We have an array `numbers` containing integers.
2. We use the `map()` method to apply a function that doubles each number.
3. The provided function takes `number` as the `currentValue` and returns `number * 2`.
4. The resulting array, `doubledNumbers`, contains the doubled values of the original elements.

The `map()` method is versatile and can be used to transform elements in various ways, such as applying mathematical operations, formatting data, or generating new objects based on the original array's elements. It's a fundamental tool in functional programming and makes working with arrays more efficient and concise.
