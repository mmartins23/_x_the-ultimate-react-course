# Short-Circuiting And Logical Operators: &&, ||, ??

Short-circuiting and logical operators (&& and ||) in JavaScript are used to perform conditional evaluations efficiently. They allow you to control the flow of your code based on certain conditions. Here are explanations and code examples for both && and || operators:

**Logical AND (&&):**
- The && operator returns true only if both operands are true. If the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated, because the overall result will be false.
- Example:

```javascript
const a = true;
const b = false;

const result = a && b; // Since 'a' is true and 'b' is false, the result is false.
console.log(result); // Output: false
```

**Logical OR (||):**
- The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. If the first operand is true, the second operand is not evaluated, because the overall result will be true.
- Example:

```javascript
const x = true;
const y = false;

const result = x || y; // Since 'x' is true, the result is true, and 'y' is not evaluated.
console.log(result); // Output: true
```

**Using Short-Circuiting:**
- Short-circuiting can be used for conditional assignments and to avoid potential errors when accessing properties or variables that might be undefined or null.

```javascript
const user = null;

// Using && to access a property if 'user' exists
const username = user && user.name; // If 'user' is null, 'user.name' is not evaluated.

// Using || to provide a default value
const defaultName = username || "Guest"; // If 'username' is falsy, "Guest" is used as the default.

console.log(username); // Output: null (no error)
console.log(defaultName); // Output: "Guest"
```

These examples demonstrate how && and || operators can help you control the flow of your code and handle different scenarios efficiently. They are commonly used in conditional statements, parameter assignments, and error handling.
